	Abstract = {Falls are one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in older adults. Every year, an estimated 30-40% of patients over the age of 65 will fall at least once. Falls lead to moderate to severe injuries, fear of falling, loss of independence and death in a third of those patients. The direct costs alone from fall related injuries are a staggering 0.1% of all healthcare expenditures in the United States and up to 1.5% of healthcare costs in European countries. This figure does not include the indirect costs of loss of income both to the patient and caregiver, the intangible losses of mobility, confidence, and functional independence. Numerous studies have attempted to define the risk factors for falls in older adults. The present review provides a brief summary and update of the relevant literature, summarizing demographic and modifiable risk factors. The major risk factors identified are impaired balance and gait, polypharmacy, and history of previous falls. Other risk factors include advancing age, female gender, visual impairments, cognitive decline especially attention and executive dysfunction, and environmental factors. Recommendations for the clinician to manage falls in older patients are also summarized.},

In this paper we study the use of a barometer placed at the user's head (e.g., embedded in a pair of glasses) as a means to improve current wearable sensor-based fall detection methods. This approach proves useful to reliably detect falls even if the acceleration produced during the impact is relatively small. Prompt detection of a fall and/or an abnormal lying condition is key to minimize the negative effect on health.",

ABSTRACT = {According to nihseniorhealth.gov (a website for older adults), falling represents a great threat as people get older, and providing mechanisms to detect and prevent falls is critical to improve people’s lives. Over 1.6 million U.S. adults are treated for fall-related injuries in emergency rooms every year suffering fractures, loss of independence, and even death. It is clear then, that this problem must be addressed in a prompt manner, and the use of pervasive computing plays a key role to achieve this. Fall detection (FD) and fall prevention (FP) are research areas that have been active for over a decade, and they both strive for improving people’s lives through the use of pervasive computing. This paper surveys the state of the art in FD and FP systems, including qualitative comparisons among various studies. It aims to serve as a point of reference for future research on the mentioned systems. A general description of FD and FP systems is provided, including the different types of sensors used in both approaches. Challenges and current solutions are presented and described in great detail. A 3-level taxonomy associated with the risk factors of a fall is proposed. Finally, cutting edge FD and FP systems are thoroughly reviewed and qualitatively compared, in terms of design issues and other parameters.},

In an attempt to measure this entity, various definitions have evolved. Tinetti and Powell3 described FOF as an ongoing concern about falling that ultimately limits the performance of daily activities. Other authors4,5 have referred to FOF as a patient's loss of confidence in his or her balance abilities. Still other authors6 defined FOF as a general concept that described low fall-related efficacy (low confidence at avoiding falls) and being afraid of falling. Subjects in one study7 indicated they did not describe themselves as being â€œafraid of falling,â€ but rather were â€œworriedâ€ about falling.}",

The technology and products related to fall detection have always been in high demand within the security and the health-care industries. An effective fall detection system is required to provide urgent support and to significantly reduce the medical care costs associated with falls. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of different systems for fall detection and their underlying algorithms. Fall detection approaches are divided into three main categories: wearable device based, ambience device based and vision based. These approaches are summarised and compared with each other and a conclusion is derived with some discussions on possible future work.}

One-quarter of these patients died within one year of the fall, five times as many as in an age- and sex-matched control group; while of those who lay on the floor for more than one hour, half died within six months of the fall. Factors associated with mortality from falls were impaired mobility, abnormal balance, and a disturbed pattern of gait.
