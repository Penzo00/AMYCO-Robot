# Mushdex
A Pokédex about mushrooms
We will use a Raspberry Pi 5 with its camera for real-time inference using a segmentation network that recognizes the presence of mushrooms in the scene and identifies their biology "membership". Additionally, based on certain physical characteristics, it can determine if the mushroom is poisonous or edible. The alarm is a preliminar for the true observation, which is done taking a static photo (in addition there is an illumination/environment corrector).
To do: 
- Download all photos in the CSV file in https://mushroomobserver.org/articles/20.
- Download the photos (300px dimension) in https://sites.google.com/view/danish-fungi-dataset.
- Create folders and subfolders using the METADATA file found in https://sites.google.com/view/danish-fungi-dataset, as kingdom -> phylum -> class -> order -> family -> genus -> species.
- Move the additional type of mushrooms from the mushroomobserver thing to the right folders, to increase the number of vailable species.
- See you on 29th of september
