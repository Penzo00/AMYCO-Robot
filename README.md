# Mushdex
A Pok√©dex about mushrooms
We will use a Raspberry Pi 5 with its camera for real-time inference using a segmentation network that recognizes the presence of mushrooms in the scene and identifies their genus. Additionally, based on certain physical characteristics, it can determine if the mushroom is poisonous or edible.
An alarm clock will wake up our mycologist in the morning when a mass appearance of mushrooms is likely to occur, based on the location.
To do: 
- Download all photos from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m1o91dwd1nto6w0/AADACdc0WF_oIAyKN5W1UvDta/images_files/complete_dataset/TRAIN_2006-2015?dl=0&subfolder_nav_tracking=1
- Use the Python module "scrape_image_for_year.py" to download all photos from 2016 to 2024. Check the instructions here: https://github.com/bechtle/mushroomobser-dataset
- Create a neural network for genus classification and mushroom detection on-screen.
- Finalize the machine learning model for determining mushroom edibility (almost done).
- Research how to implement GPS and alarm clock functions on the Raspberry Pi.
